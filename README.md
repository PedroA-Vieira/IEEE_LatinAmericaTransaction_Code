# Instructions for running the programs
The programs were written in Python version 3.7, the IDE Spyder version 5.3.3 was used and a specific virtual environment was created to execute the programs.
The main necessary libraries (dependencies) are right at the beginning of the program.
The FilesDataFrame folder contains the pre-processed data used to carry out the analyzes and tests.
Within programs, the search path for data files must be adjusted.
