# Instructions for running the programs

* The programs were written in Python version 3.7, the IDE Spyder version 5.3.3 was used and a specific virtual environment was created to execute the programs
* The main necessary libraries (dependencies) are right at the beginning of the program
* The ArquivosDataFrame folder contains the pre-processed data used to carry out the analyzes and tests as weel systens data
* Within programs, the search path for data files must be adjusted.
